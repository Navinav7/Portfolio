                    <h2> Data Analysis</h2>
                    <p> In my role as a Quality Control Specialist I performed daily and weekly QC reviews, by evaluating quality control data/ performance of various laboratory assays using levey-jennings charts. Subsequently, I would debug issues in coordination with testing operators/lab technicians to identify the root cause of QC failures and create actions plans to resolve performance issues.

                  <p> During my time as a senior Medical Technologist I Conducted and documented weekend team huddles as part of the laboratories initiative to build better communication and collaboration amongst lab personnel within the department; the huddle meetings are similar to a daily standup and provide a quick way to assess any roadblocks or assistance needed within the different lab testing areas.
