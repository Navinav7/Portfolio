            <p>üé∂üé∂üé∂üéµ‚Äù Allow me to introduce myself, my name is NAVI (oh), N-to-the-A-V... Ok I‚Äôll stop. My name is Navirlene, and I am writer. I started writing during my undergraduate program as way to organize my thoughts and express the new feelings/experience of being awakened to what it meant to be a black, Haitian American woman in this world. Writing grounded me during the most turbulent times of my college career and it still does today.I am a Medical Lab Scientist and half of my year is spent in the lab and other half is spent with my family/ creating. This podcast is my creation and I‚Äôve always wanted to provide a platform for my story and our (black community)stories,that are too often silenced,  to be told. There is power in telling our stories and using it as a tool to learn, to teach, to inspire, to grow and to empower one another.</p>
